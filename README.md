This is the IRCv3 Working Group's _ideas_ repo. New feature and specification ideas are workshopped here before they are ready to be submitted to the [ircv3-specification](https://github.com/ircv3/ircv3-specifications) repository proper.

Check out the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ircv3/ircv3-ideas/issues) to see which ideas have been proposed and discussed.

Pull requests should not be submitted to this repository. If more extensive text is to be discussed in issues, it should be created as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/) and linked to.
